  <P>Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James
     Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle
     Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software
     and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used
     in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile
     phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets, which are
     less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure,
     sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications
     hrough being embedded in HTML pages.
